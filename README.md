## Journey to master NLP and Hugging face libraries

This GitHub repository illustrates my journey for my first NLP project in a long time ago using transformer-based architectures that predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not.
A dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand-classified is available.

From this repository, I want to use the different libraries provided by Hugguing Face to learn:
- load large-scale datasets to pytorch models
- what are the different options to tokenize text
- fine-tuning different models 
- understand the model architectures and evaluate their performance using a simple task
