# Mastering NLP with Hugging Face Libraries: A Transformative Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I document my exploration and mastery of Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Hugging Face libraries, focusing on transformer-based architectures. This project marks my return to NLP after a significant hiatus, showcasing my journey through the intricacies of modern NLP methodologies.

## Project Overview

The core of this project is to develop and refine a predictive model that distinguishes between Tweets related to actual disasters and those that are not, utilizing a dataset of 10,000 manually classified tweets. This endeavor not only reacquaints me with the NLP field but also leverages the cutting-edge libraries offered by Hugging Face to deepen my understanding and skills in several key areas:

- **Data Loading**: Efficiently loading large-scale datasets into PyTorch models, a critical skill for handling real-world NLP tasks.
- **Text Tokenization**: Exploring various text tokenization techniques to prepare data for processing by transformer models, understanding the nuances and applications of each.
- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Delving into the fine-tuning process to adapt pre-existing models to our specific task, optimizing performance through targeted adjustments.
- **Architecture Mastery**: Gaining a comprehensive understanding of transformer model architectures, including their design principles and evaluation metrics, to assess their effectiveness for specific NLP tasks.

## Learning and Development

A pivotal component of my journey involves synthesizing knowledge from esteemed resources, such as the insightful analysis presented in [Peter Bloem's blog post on transformers](https://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers). This foundation will support my endeavor to construct a transformer model from the ground up.

### Building Mamba from Scratch

To demonstrate my acquired proficiency and confidence in creating transformer models, I will undertake the ambitious task of developing the [Mamba model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752) from scratch. This initiative will serve as a practical application of my learning, showcasing my ability to navigate and implement complex NLP models.

## Conclusion

This repository is more than just a compilation of code; it represents a comprehensive learning journey through the fascinating world of NLP, powered by the innovative tools provided by Hugging Face. Through diligent study, experimentation, and application, I aim to not only master the technical aspects of transformer-based architectures but also contribute to the field of NLP with my insights and developments.

I invite you to explore this repository and join me on this transformative journey into the heart of NLP and transformer technology.
